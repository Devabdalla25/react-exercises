            <p>When a passenger misses the return segment of a round-trip ticket—like MGQ to NBO and back—airlines should offer flexible rebooking options. <br></br>In one case, a customer completed the outbound flight but missed the return. She requested to change her return date instead of losing the ticket. <br></br>Offering support in such situations builds trust, reduces frustration, and shows commitment to customer care.<br></br>Airlines that provide flexible, clear rebooking policies turn potential problems into loyalty-building opportunities.</p>
